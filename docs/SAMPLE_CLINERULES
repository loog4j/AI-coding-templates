# Sample Project - Cline Rules

## Project Overview
This is a sample project demonstrating the use of the project management template system. Replace this with your actual project description.

## Project Structure
```
/sample-project/
├── MASTER_PLAN.md      # Renamed from template
├── PROGRESS.md         # Real-time progress tracking
├── tasks/              # Individual task files
│   ├── TASK-01-setup.md
│   ├── TASK-02-config.md
│   ├── TASK-03-implementation.md
│   └── ...
├── .clinerules         # This file (copied from PROJECT_CLINERULES.md)
├── src/                # Project source code
├── tests/              # Test files
└── docs/               # Documentation
```

## Task Execution Order
1. Start with MASTER_PLAN.md for project overview
2. Execute tasks sequentially: TASK-01 → TASK-02 → TASK-03 → etc.
3. Each task has prerequisites that must be completed first
4. Validate each task completion before moving to the next

## Key Information
- **Working Directory**: /path/to/your/project
- **Technology Stack**: [Your tech stack here]
- **External Dependencies**: [APIs, services, databases]
- **Target Environment**: [Development/staging/production details]

## Development Guidelines
1. Always check task prerequisites before starting
2. Update PROGRESS.md after every significant action
3. Test incrementally after each major component
4. Document any deviations from the plan
5. Validate all steps using provided commands

## Testing Requirements
- Run validation commands after each step
- Test with various scenarios (success/failure cases)
- Verify all integrations work correctly
- Ensure error handling works for edge cases
- Document test results in PROGRESS.md

## Critical Rules (DO NOT IGNORE)
1. **READ PROGRESS.md FIRST** before starting any work
2. **UPDATE PROGRESS.md** after every action
3. **VALIDATE EVERY STEP** using provided commands
4. **DOCUMENT DECISIONS** and deviations immediately
5. **COMPLETE HANDOFF INFO** before ending sessions

## Quick Start Commands
```bash
# Verify environment
ls -la

# Check project state
cat PROGRESS.md

# Run basic validation
[your project-specific validation command]
```

**REMEMBER**: This system only works if you consistently update PROGRESS.md and follow the validation procedures. When in doubt, document your current state!
